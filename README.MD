# Tetris

Welcome to **Tetris**, a Tetris game developed in C# using Visual Studio and the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application framework.

## üéÆ Features

- Modern and responsive graphical interface.
- Smooth animations and user interactions.
- Intuitive controls for moving, rotating, and placing pieces.
- Scoring system to track your performance.

## üöÄ Why WPF?

I chose **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** to develop this game because:

1. **Powerful Graphics**: WPF offers advanced tools for creating modern and visually appealing graphical interfaces through XAML. This includes animations, transformations, and custom controls‚Äîperfect for a game like Tetris.

2. **Flexibility**: Unlike Windows Forms, WPF allows for more modular interface design and better separation of logic from design using patterns like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), even if this project doesn't fully implement MVVM.

3. **Resolution Independence**: WPF uses device-independent units, ensuring consistent appearance across different screens and resolutions.

4. **Modernity**: WPF is more suitable for modern applications compared to WinForms, which is an older technology with limitations for complex or animated interfaces.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have:

- **Visual Studio** (or any compatible .NET editor)
- **.NET SDK 5.0** installed
